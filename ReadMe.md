# Address-book - C++

###  • An address book that illustrates the principles of Object-Oriented Programming. The address book can create, search, display, modify and delete entries users make into the address book.   

###  • Data was allocated into and extracted from files. Implemented a search functionality for the address book, later upgraded by adding the most searched feature.

 This Project was implemented as a degree course project and cannot be used elsewhere for any other purposes.<br/>
 This is just a sample of the source code to the project.<br/>
 The original project has 1500 lines of code with hospital, Mall and Restaurants<br/>
